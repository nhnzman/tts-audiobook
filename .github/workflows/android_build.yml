name: Build Android APK

# This workflow runs on every push to the main branch and on pull requests.
# It builds the release variant of the Rao TTS app and uploads the
# resulting APK as a GitHub Actions artifact.  The workflow expects the
# following secrets to be configured in the repository settings:
#
# * `KEYSTORE_FILE` – base64‑encoded keystore file used for signing
# * `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` – password for the keystore
# * `KEY_ALIAS` – alias of the key within the keystore
# * `KEY_PASSWORD` – password for the signing key
